        content: `Why You Should Stop Shortening the Tasleem

 

        Abu Naasir Ibrahim Abdur-Rauf (May ALlaah preserve him upon Goodness)
        
        Question: Can we shorten the Tasleem. SWW, SLM and WWW?
        
        Answer: No, don’t shorten it. People want to say Assalamu ‘alaikum Warahmotullahi Wabarakaatuh. They now say ASWWW. Laa, don’t do that. Because it’s ‘Ebaadah.
        
        ‘Abdullah bin Abbas-Radiyallaahu ‘anhu- said we would consider the Tasleem of writing as we consider the tasleem of speech.
        
        Imaam Bukhaaree reported that in al-Adabu Al-Mufraad, (That) our consideration we would give to tasleem of writing is the same consideration we would give to the tasleem of speech.
        
        So, in speech, can you say brother, 'SWW'?, Sister, 'SWW'? You can’t say that.
        
        So, the correct thing to say is As-salaamu ‘alaikum. (Even) if it is that, you have ten rewards. But SWW, Allah didn’t promise you anything o. Allah didn’t promise anything for WWW.
        
        If you say it will take your time, Allah will reward that time. 
        
        Maalakum? What is wrong with us, Where are we running to?
        
        These things are acts of worship! 
        
        The same thing if you say ‘Salam’, -S A L A M-, you have not said Tasleem o!
        
        Brothers, (Salam), Maa anzalallaahu bihaa min sultaan.
        
        The least you can say is what?, ‘’Salaamun ‘alaikum’ Least! But Salam, it does not have basis.
        
        Likewise, Ma’a Salam, Maa anzalallaahu bihaa min sultaan - Allah has not ordained it.
        
        Ma’a Salam, Egyptians say it a lot and those who studied in Egypt (say) Ma’a salama, laa. 
        
        If you’re departing, you can say: As-Salaamu ‘alaikum warahmotullah or As-Salaamu ‘alaikum.
        
        In Greeting, there is no Ma’a Salam value there o!
        
        If you say Ma’a Salam, you just wasted the breath, no reward.
        
        So, we should say:
        
        As-Saalamu ‘alaikum or
        
        Assaalamu ‘alaikum Warahmotullahi or
        
        As-Salaamun ‘alaikum Warahmotullahi Wabarakaatuh.
        
        When you are responding you can say: Wa ‘alaikumu Salam, if the person says As-salamu ‘alaikum.
        
        If the person says As-Salaamu ‘alaikum Warahmotullah, you too (you) can say: Wa ‘alaikum Saalam Warahmotullah.
        
        But it is prohibited for you if the person says: As-Saalamu ‘alaikum Warahmotullah, (it is wrong) to say, Wa ‘alaikum Salaam.
        
        You must add 'Warahmatullah'
        
        You are either equalizing or saying more than him in response. You must not say less than the person who is starting, who is initiating the Tasleem. You must not say less. You either say equal or say more. Allahu a’alam!
        
        But Salam, Ma’a Salam, WWW, SWW. 
        
         
        
        Likewise, when we say Sallallaahu ‘alyh' Wa alyh' Wasallam, we should not say SWW.
        
        Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd said that in his Mu’jam.
        
        He has a compilation of expressions that are innovations. One of them is Sallallahu ‘alaihi wa ahlihi wasallam, (People write it as SAW). Don’t write SAW. It is better for you not to write anything. When you mention the Prophet’s name, you stop there and use your mouth to say Allahuma Salli ‘alaa Muhammad to the end or Sallallahu ‘alaihi wa ahlihi Wasallam and continue writing. 
        
        There are some among the Scholars of Hadith who do that. 
        
        When they write the Prophet’s name, they would use their mouth to say ‘alahi-ssalaatu was-Salaam and continue writing. They would not write anything.
        
        But the best is to say it and then write it. Yes, there is a hadith that whoever writes Sallallaahu ‘alihi wa ahlihi wasallam, the reward of making Salaat and Salaam on the Messenger will be coming to him as long as that writing is there. That Hadith is da’eef, it’s not authentic. It occurs in the book “Jalaaul Af’haam fee salaati was-salaami ‘alaa khayril Anaam by Al-Imam Ibnul Qayyim”.
        
        So, we should check it up In Shaa Allah.`,
